GIT IS A DISTRIBUTED VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM 
THAT ENABLES MULTIPLE DEVELOPERS TO COLLABORATE ON PROJECTS 
WHILE EFFICIENTLY MANAGING CHANGES TO THE CODEBASE.
 IT ALLOWS USERS TO TRACK MODIFICATIONS, REVERT TO PREVIOUS STATES, 
AND CREATE BRANCHES FOR NEW FEATURES OR EXPERIMENTAL WORK 
WITHOUT AFFECTING THE MAIN CODE. GIT OPERATES THROUGH A REPOSITORY SYSTEM, 
WHERE COMMITS CAPTURE SNAPSHOTS OF THE PROJECT, 
AND REMOTE REPOSITORIES FACILITATE COLLABORATION AMONG TEAM MEMBERS. 
THIS MAKES IT EASIER TO COORDINATE WORK, MANAGE VERSIONS, 
AND RESOLVE CONFLICTS, ULTIMATELY ENHANCING PRODUCTIVITY IN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS.
